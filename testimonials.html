<p class="pg-desc">See what others have said! I have constructed several projects for family and friends, and a few for myself personally. Here are a few remarks about the various projects I have completed.</p>

<div class="testimonials">
	<blockquote>
		<p>"Tyler made custom butcher block counters for us when we renovated our kitchen. The results turned out great! He was very professional when he came to take measurements and when the final product was installed. He was extemely knowledgeable with any questions that we had and made sure everything turned out the way we wanted. The counters are beautiful! Cut perfectly, well stained and finished. We love them!"

	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"I asked Tyler to build a cupboard for me to store my coffee mug collection. He did a great job, as I love the look of the green milk paint and cherry wood together. It's exactly what I wanted. I love it!"
		<small>- Sarah</small></p>
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"We have the 18th Century Pennsylvania Secretary Desk and Virginia Corner Cabinet that Tyler made. The craftsmanship is amazing. Not only are the two pieces of furniture very beautiful, but they are very well constructed. You can tell that each cut and each design carved into the wood was very carefully thought out. They are flawless and beautiful pieces of art that always strike up a conversation from visitors."
