</div>
	<p>Probably my favorite piece that I have constructed. It has Goose neck molding on top, tombstone doors, serpentine drawers in the gallery as well as a few hidden compartments. I put my own spin on the original design plan, but it remains true to the era in which it was popular.</p>
	<p><small>Type of wood: Cherry and some Poplar</small></p>

</div>
<p>This is my second piece I built while learning the craft at the University of Rio Grande. It was a lot of fun to build. It has cabriole legs and lipped drawers with half blind dovetails. I learned a lot about case work on this project.</p>

	<h2 class="h3title">Virginia Corner Cabinet</h2>

</div>
<p>I completed this piece during my third year at the University of Rio Grande. It has a lot of applied moldings, a tombstone door as well as a muntin door on top. The glass in the top door came out of a house built in the 1800's in Columbus, Ohio.</p>


	<h2 class="h3title">Spice Box</h2>
<div class="project-works">
	<a href="images/gallery/spicecabinet/full_front_closed.jpg" class="gal-piece1" rel="thumbnail" title=""><img src="images/gallery/spicecabinet/full_front_closed-thumb.jpg" class="img-responsive" title="Spice Box" alt="Spice Box, full front view closed" /></a>

</div>
<p>I am very proud of this Piece. I took a trip to Winterthur Museum in Delaware, and spent some time in their library and found a picture of this spice box. I was able to scale the dimensions from the photo and reproduce this piece. The original piece had rosettes made of brass or metal of some kind. I have not been able to find anything suitable to replicate. I may carve them in the future.</p>
<p><small>Type of wood: Walnut and some Poplar</small></p>


	<h2 class="h3title">Shaker Night Stand</h2>
<div class="project-works">

</div>
<p>This is the first project I made at the University of Rio Grande. It was a great starter piece for me as I learned to properly mill lumber and how to construct a drawer with hand cut dovetails during this build. The Shakers were all about "function over form" and this night stand fits that motto perfectly. It is mostly straight lines and nothing too fancy. It has a purpose and it works!</p>
<p><small>Type of wood: Walnut and some Poplar</small></p>


	<h2 class="h3title">Kitchen Counter-Tops</h2>
<div class="project-works">

</div>
<p>Thsee are a butcher-block style counter-top. I had to modify some pre-made tops to make them work but they turned out to be beautiful. They are stained with General Finished Jave Gel Stain and sealed with Gloss Arm-R-Seal</p>
<p><small>Type of wood: Hard Maple</small></p>
