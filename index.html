<p class="pg-desc">I am Tyler Will, and I can be found in Columbus, Ohio. My art, and my passion, is wood crafting, and this website showcases my various experience and projects in Fine Woodworking.</p>

<p>My goal is to always produce exceptionally handcrafted woodworking creations while continually learning new techniques and gaining as much experience as possible. Using the experience and education I have gained through school, various projects, and hard work in the industry, I deliver high quality creations and I am grateful to have a career doing what I love most.</p>

<h2 class="h2title center">The "cut of my grain"</h2>
<p>Creating household or functional projects in woodworking grabbed my attention at a young age, but I developed a passion for it during my high school "shop" class. I created several small projects and learned how to make use of the various tools of the trade in this class. Like everyone, I dreamed to do what I love and enjoy for a career so I then acquired a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Technology focusing on Woodworking. Currently, I work for Woodcraft selling all things woodworking related and using their workshop to develop my skills further and conducting classes for fellow enthusiasts.</p>
